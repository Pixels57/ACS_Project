# Vulnerability Report: TLS Certificate Misconfiguration

## 1. Executive Summary
**Vulnerability:** TLS Certificate Misconfiguration
**Severity:** Medium
**CVSS v3.1 Score:** 5.3 (Medium)
**Affected Component:** Backend HTTPS server (`https://localhost:8000`)

The application uses a self-signed TLS certificate with multiple misconfigurations that prevent proper certificate validation and hostname verification. The certificate has expired validity, incorrect Common Name, and lacks Subject Alternative Names. This causes browsers to display security warnings and allows potential man-in-the-middle attacks if users bypass certificate warnings. The misconfiguration also prevents proper TLS validation in automated security tools and API clients.

## 2. Technical Details

### Vulnerability Analysis
**Certificate Configuration:**
The backend server uses a self-signed certificate generated by `generate_misconfigured_cert.py` with intentional security misconfigurations.

**Certificate Misconfigurations:**
1.  **Expired Certificate:** Certificate validity period expired 6 months ago (valid from 1 year ago to 6 months ago). Modern browsers and TLS clients reject expired certificates.
2.  **Wrong Common Name (CN):** Certificate CN is set to `wrong-domain.example.com` instead of `localhost`, causing hostname verification failures.
3.  **Missing Subject Alternative Names (SAN):** Certificate lacks SAN entries for `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, preventing access via IP addresses.
4.  **Self-Signed Certificate:** Certificate is self-signed with no chain of trust, requiring manual trust in certificate stores.
5.  **No Certificate Trust:** Certificate is not trusted in system certificate stores, causing browser security warnings.

**Impact:**
- Browsers display "Not Secure" warnings, potentially training users to ignore security warnings
- Automated security tools fail TLS validation
- API clients cannot verify certificate authenticity
- Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks if users bypass warnings
- Hostname verification failures prevent secure connections

### Attack Scenario
1.  The application server starts with the misconfigured certificate.
2.  A user attempts to access `https://localhost:8000` in their browser.
3.  The browser detects multiple certificate issues:
    - Certificate expired
    - Hostname mismatch (CN doesn't match localhost)
    - Untrusted certificate authority
4.  Browser displays security warning: "Your connection is not private" or "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"
5.  User may bypass the warning by clicking "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
6.  If an attacker controls the network, they could present a different certificate and the user might not notice the difference.
7.  Alternatively, automated tools and API clients fail to connect due to certificate validation failures.
